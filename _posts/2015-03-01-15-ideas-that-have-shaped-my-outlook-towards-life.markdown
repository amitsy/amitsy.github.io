![](/assets/images/1*iyLfrdH4G7B3Bgxtgq9Vdg.jpeg)I have been feeling unproductive lately. Hence, wanted to make a playlist of all my favourite inspirational videos for easy access. Then decided to annotate them as well — to remember why I liked them. After much thought, decided to make a blog post instead (if I was going to do that much hard work anyways).

Here are 15 videos that have helped shape my outlook on life, career, religion, education and learning. Each of them contain certain unique ideas/theories that resonate with what I think about the world.

The videos range from advertisements, commencement speeches, spoken word, stand up, award acceptance speeches, TED talks, movie scenes to whatever else I find inspiring.

Outlook towards life
--------------------

### 1. Moonshot thinking

This video by Google talks about achieving impossible things, and by examples, shows how it is this “Moonshot thinking” that has transformed the world throughout history.


> We choose to go to moon in this decade and do the other things. Not because they are easy, but because they are hard.### 2. Here’s to the Crazy Ones

This amazing advertisement by Apple (originally launched in 1997) talks about how throughout history, the greatest achievers have always been misfits. And —


> People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.### 3. Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish

Another gem by Steve Jobs; delivered at 2005 Stanford Commencement address . Here, he talks about three stories from his life

* Connecting the dots: How a calligraphy class Jobs took in Reed after dropping out, proved to be such a significant event in the history of computing.

> It is impossible to connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards. Believing that the dots will connect in future, gives you the confidence to follow your heart.* Love and loss : Jobs talks about how him getting fired from Apple, was the best thing that happened to him and how that failure led to so many successes in future.

> The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.* Death : Jobs talks about how remembering he’ll be dead soon helped him make the most important decisions in his life.

> If you live each day as if it were your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.
> If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?### 4. Jim Carrey’s commencement address

Jim Carrey gives one of the most inspirational commencement speeches ever at Maharishi University of Management in 2014. Find the transcript of the full address [here](http://genius.com/Jim-carrey-maharishi-university-of-management-commencement-speech-annotated/). Two ideas in his speech that captured my attention immensely —


> You can fail at what you don’t want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.
> Your pursuit of acceptance can make you invisible in this world.### 5. I will not let an exam result decide my fate

This spoken word poetry by a 17 year old [Suli Breaks](http://sulibreaks.com/) communicates my views about the education system as well. Even though I do believe in “Connect the Dots” theory and the fact that education does shape the way we think, this piece by Suli perfectly resonates with some of my complains about the education system and society as well.


> Whether 72 or 88 or 44 or 68… we will not let exam results decide our fate. Peace### 6. Mathew McConaughey’s Academy Award acceptance speech

I truly appreciate Mathew’s concept of him needing three things each day:

1. Someone to look up to
2. Something to look forward to
3. Someone to chase
The idea of chasing his future self as a hero is something I have decided to incorporate in my life as well.

### 7. Sonder

Sonder is the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own — populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness — an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.

[The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows](http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/) has many such invented words that describe powerful emotions like these.

### 8. Invisible man

George Carlin and his ideas about God, religion and society are extremely logical and also resonate with my world view. Whenever I feel like getting a grip on how I feel about society, I watch a few of his shows— and he never fails to amaze.


> Religion has actually convinced people that there’s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever ‘til the end of time!
> But He loves you.Outlook towards career

### 9. What if money was no object?

Alan Watts’ idea of pursuing a life with money as no object, is something which has had a deep impact on my rationality. His talks along with [The 4-hour Workweek ](http://fourhourworkweek.com/)have tremendously effected the way I think about my career.


> If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time. You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, which is stupid. Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way.EDIT(11th Spet ‘15): Recently came across this commencement speech by Ben Horowitz, which challenges the idea of “following your passion”. This along with the previous one, pretty much sums up my view on career choices.

### 10. Music and Life

Another one of Alan Watts’ classics. Here he talks about the life of an average person and how society’s expectations from him, hamper the way he should have been living his life.

### 11. How great leaders inspire action

Simon Sinek’s idea of [Starting with Why](https://www.startwithwhy.com/) is something I try to incorporate in my personal and professional life as much as possible. One of the very first TED talks that shaped my thinking about the world.


> People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe.### 12. The Social Network : Facemash Scene

The Social Network is one movie that inspires me to be an entrepreneur and create stuff whenever I watch it. Even though startup life is portrayed very glamorously in the movie, it still is one of my favourites. I was so inspired by the Facemash scene in the movie that I went ahead and made a Facemash clone myself using the Chess Player Ranking Algorithm shown in the movie.

Outlook towards learning
------------------------

### 13. Nobody tells this to beginners

Ira Glass talks about how in the initial part of creative careers, there is always a gap between expectations and the real quality of the art created. And it happens to everybody.

This comes as a real reassurance as to why I suck.

### 14. You can learn anything

This video from Khan Academy comes as a good reassurance in my pursuit to learn everything.


> Nobody is born smart. We all start at 0.### 15. How to learn anything

This talk by Josh Kaufman begins by stating how the current understanding of the Malcolm Gladwell’s [10,000 Rule](http://gladwell.com/outliers/the-10000-hour-rule/) is fundamentally flawed (which comes as a real relief). He also goes on to provide a framework to learn anything… fast.


> The order of magnitude from knowing absolutely nothing to being really good is about 20 hours — not 10,000 hours. 20 hours is 40 minutes a day for a month.
